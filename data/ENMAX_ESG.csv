Not only must we provide our customers with access to safe, reliable and affordable energy, but we must do so responsibly.
Our environmental, social and governance (ESG) framework helps us define what this responsibility entails.
In 2021 ENMAX took the next step in our longstanding commitment to ESG.
After over a decade of reporting on our sustainability efforts, we presented our first formal ESG report with targets against which we could measure our progress on our ESG journey.
This year, we begin sharing our performance and progress towards achieving those targets.
I'm proud of our team members across Alberta and Maine who have worked hard to drive our progress towards these important objectives.
Throughout 2021, the health and safety of our team members and customers remained our highest priority and we continued to advance a strong safety culture as we adapted to the global COVID-19 pandemic.
As a team, we understand that being diverse and inclusive fosters unique perspectives that enhance our culture, as well as inspire creativity and innovation.
We worked towards more inclusive leadership, enabling a culture of belonging.
ESG SCORECARD ABOUT ENMAX ENVIRONMENT The overall theme for 2021 has been one of progress.
In the pages of this report, you will learn how ENMAX is progressing towards a cleaner energy future.
We support Canada's ambition to become net zero by 2050 and want to be part of the solution.
We continue to work towards our own goal of becoming net zero by 2050 by evaluating and leveraging advancements in technology.
We have reduced our GHG emissions by 66 per cent from 2015 to 2021, significant progress towards our interim reduction target of 70 per cent by 2030.
In addition to doing our part to address our impact on climate change, we want to help our customers meet their sustainability goals.
Our customers want solutions that will decrease their environmental footprint: actionable insights into their energy consumption, residential solar systems and electric vehicle opportunities.
We are investing in the electric grid to ensure our reliable and resilient infrastructure will meet future demand.
Energy affordability must go hand in hand with reliability.
In 2021, we contributed $3.25 million to Alberta and Maine community organizations.
To support customers in need, 30 per cent of our community investment budget was spent on energy affordability initiatives, including energy education and energy saving kits that will go to 1,000 homes by the end of 2022.
We are committed to continue working to address the energy affordability challenge through collaboration with our community partners, and an overarching focus on affordable electricity for all of our customers.
As I look back on 2021, I would like to thank the members of the ENMAX team for their hard work to ensure the lights stayed on for our valued customers.
As I look to 2022 and beyond, I'm excited about the progress we will make towards achieving our ESG objectives.
Finally, I would like to thank our customers, who are the focus of everything we do.
They trust us to safely and reliably provide an essential service that we all count on each and every day.
We take that responsibility seriously, today and into the future.

< 5 TCFD APPENDICES ENMAX 2021 ENVIRONMENTAL , SOCIAL & GOVERNANCE REPORT CEO LETTER ESG SCORECARD Developing a net-zero pathway In 2021, we shared our ambition to achieve net-zero scope 1 and scope 2 GHG emissions by 2050.
As with any longer-term target, success would not be possible without realistic near-term milestones and thoughtful planning.
Milestones provide ambitious, yet achievable, guideposts on our journey and we are working towards a 70 per cent reduction of scope 1 and scope 2 GHG emissions by 2030 from 2015 levels.
The illustration on the right represents a progression we envision to achieve net zero by 2050.
While the specifics continue to be developed, the categories we are exploring are based on our current understanding of existing, emerging and potential future technologies.
As technologies advance and become commercially available, and as the energy transition uncovers new possibilities, our pathway will become more defined.
We plan to update our understanding of these opportunities as they change over time and will provide additional detail on our progress in our next report.

£ ↓ £ ↑ 6 ENMAX 2021 ENVIRONMENTAL , SOCIAL & GOVERNANCE REPORT CEO LETTER GOVERNANCE TCFD APPENDICES GHG Action Plans During 2022, our focus is to develop GHG Action Plans for all GHG-emitting facilities and business units across ENMAX.
The GHG Action Plans identify benchmark (2015) and projected GHG emissions that are aligned with our budget and long-range plan.
The plans identify potential mitigation actions with estimated emission reductions and costs.
The plans connect to the Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) program to verify that mitigation actions are focused on climate-related risks for each business unit.
As we complete additional work in our journey to net zero, we intend to establish and publish additional milestone targets to keep us on track.
These plans will be updated annually as we continue to adapt to a changing business environment.
Principles guiding our planning We use the following principles to guide us in our exploration of future opportunities.
WE ARE OPEN TO NEW TECHNOLOGIES We believe a combination of technologies and solutions will be required (renewables, fuel and energy efficiencies, energy storage and CCUS) to achieve Canadian and global decarbonization goals.
ENMAX will continue to invest in exploring and implementing new technologies.
WE KEEP OUR CUSTOMERS FRONT AND CENTRE As a customer-facing utility, we consider the impacts our decisions have on our customers and on overall energy affordability.
We also consider our customers’ desire for clean electricity products and a decarbonized grid.
ESG SCORECARD ABOUT ENMAX ENVIRONMENT SOCIAL WE COLLABORATE WITH GOVERNMENTS, REGULATORS, AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS WE SEEK BROADER BENEFITS Although most projects have a clear environmental benefit, we also consider the social benefits of projects, for example considering community or Indigenous participation in energy projects.
Our pathway assumes a supportive regulatory environment and the availability and commercial viability of technologies, such as energy storage and CCUS.
We continue to engage in conversations with a variety of stakeholders to work towards common goals.
三 7 ENMAX 2021 ENVIRONMENTAL , SOCIAL & GOVERNANCE REPORT SOCIAL GOVERNANCE TCFD APPENDICES CEO LETTER ESG SCORECARD Options we are examining We are committed to enhancing our ESG performance through the exploration and adoption of technologies that can help reduce the emissions associated with our business.
While this is not an exhaustive list, some options we are exploring include: EFFICIENCIES AT NATURAL GAS GENERATION FACILITIES Our commitment to operational excellence means we regularly seek out process efficiencies and incorporate updated equipment as new technologies emerge.
Although there is a limit to the emissions reductions that can be achieved through efficiency, we continue to invest in our natural gas-fuelled generation facilities.
We do this because these facilities enable the integration of intermittent renewable assets into the Alberta grid by providing a backstop to the variability of wind and solar generation.
- RENEWABLES We own and operate two wind facilities—Taber and Kettles Hill—and hold a 50 per cent ownership stake in McBride Lake wind farm.
We are actively exploring potential capacity increases and/or life extensions of our wind facilities.
The benefits of life extension include long-term waste reduction (i.e., waste associated with decommissioning) and an increased return on capital invested.
To inform decision making, we are currently completing end-of-life studies on each wind facility.
We are also evaluating the addition of larger utility-scale solar projects into our generation portfolio to offer options to our commercial and industrial customers to purchase renewable electricity to help achieve their ESG goals.
ABOUT ENMAX ENVIRONMENT CARBON CAPTURE, UTILIZATION, AND STORAGE (CCUS) CCUS is not a new technology, but it is experiencing a surge of global interest.
According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), there are currently more than 20 large-scale CCUS commercial facilities around the globe, and Alberta has committed to fund CCUS projects.
All our power generation facilities are located near advantageous geological formations for storing carbon.
While CCUS requires large capital investment, large volumes of CO₂ can be captured and stored.
ENERGY STORAGE Energy storage using utility scale batteries increases grid flexibility and reliability.
When combined with renewable power generation, batteries can store and release power when needed, which helps balance the electrical grid during periods of low renewable electricity production.
When combined with natural gas generation (such as at our Crossfield Energy Centre) energy storage can also provide standby power without having to burn natural gas.
We will continue to stay informed on relevant technology advancements and pursue opportunities that align with our business and net-zero target.
HYDROGEN While already widely used in some industries, large- scale hydrogen combustion technology continues to advance within the power generation sector.
Already the largest hydrogen producer in Canada, Alberta released its Hydrogen Roadmap in November 2021.
Hydrogen produces no direct GHG emissions and can be blended with natural gas (often with only relatively minor retrofits to natural gas turbines) to generate lower- carbon power.
We are evaluating the feasibility of using hydrogen at our natural gas power generation facilities.
OTHER TECHNOLOGIES In the longer term, as-yet-discovered technologies will emerge and may offer new emissions reduction solutions.
Our Shepard Energy Centre is home to the Alberta Carbon Conversion Technology Centre (ACCTC), which uses exhaust gas from the facility to enable research and innovation focused on finding ways to reduce and repurpose emissions.
Existing and new clients continue to use the ACCTC to develop, validate and pilot technologies that target carbon capture and utilization.
The ACCTC also continues to contribute to economic growth in Alberta as it attracts entrepreneurs and industry conducting research and development.
This research is leading to commercially viable projects and is attracting new business from Alberta and beyond.

- For all of our targets, the date stated indicates by year end of the stated year.
For example, completing an activity by 2022, means completion by the end of 2022.
- For our companies in Alberta, we report environmental and social performance for all assets over which we have operational control, which means we report 100 per cent of data related to environment, human resources, safety and business practices for assets we operate.
The only exception to this principle is in accounting for greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions which we report based on financial ownership (see next point).
- We report GHG emissions using guidance from the Greenhouse Gas Protocol, developed by the World Resources Institute and the World Business Council for Sustainable Development, and account for our GHG emissions based on financial ownership (equity share approach).
Note that in previous sustainability reports, we had reported 100 per cent of the GHG emissions from facilities which we operated.
Reporting under the equity approach means that we include ENMAX's proportional share of the emissions from our Shepard Energy Centre, 50 per cent from our Balzac facility, and GHG emissions associated with structured power agreements such as Energy Service Agreements where ENMAX is responsible for carbon compliance obligations.
Following this principle, our 2015 baseline for our net-zero target includes GHG emissions related to our Power Purchase Arrangements (PPAs).

Met our target to offset 100% of our building GHG emissions (scope 1 and scope 2) for 2021.
WHY IT MATTERS TO ENMAX As a future-oriented essential electricity service provider, we are committed to advancing a cleaner energy future for the benefit of our customers, the communities we operate in and our Shareholder, The City of Calgary.
For many years, the reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions has been a key component of our environmental protection and stewardship practices.
OUR APPROACH ENMAX has committed to achieving net-zero scope 1 and scope 2 GHG emissions by 2050.
As a milestone towards achieving our net-zero vision, we plan to reduce or offset 70 per cent of our scope 1 and scope 2 GHG emissions by 2030 from a 2015 baseline.
To reach these targets, we are identifying efficiencies at our natural gas power generation facilities, offsetting and managing emissions from our corporate and operational buildings, and advancing the electrification of our mobile fleet.
Evolving our generation portfolio We have already achieved significant emissions reductions over the past decade due to the transition of our power generation portfolio.
When compared to our 2015 baseline, we have reduced the GHG emissions by 66 per cent.
Today, we hold no coal-fired generation in our portfolio, and our power generation facilities are a combination of modern natural gas-fuelled power generation facilities and wind facilities.
2015 2021 9% renewables 14% renewables 40% coal 51% natural gas 86% natural gas GHG emissions across our business Today, the vast majority of our GHG emissions come from our natural gas power generation facilities.
Our primary source of GHG emissions is natural gas combustion at these plants, followed by a smaller proportion originating from natural gas and electricity consumption at our corporate and operational buildings, together with fuel combustion within our mobile fleet (see table at right).
OUR PERFORMANCE GHG EMISSIONS (SCOPE 1 AND SCOPE 2) CONTRIBUTIONS BY EACH BUSINESS 2021 Power generation 99% Operational and corporate buildings 0.9% Mobile fleet 0.1% Our largest power generation facility, Shepard Energy Centre, is the most efficient natural gas-fuelled combined-cycle generation facility operating in Canada today, as measured by tonnes of CO2 per megawatt hour (MWh).
> 16 ENVIRONMENT GOVERNANCE TCFD APPENDICES ENMAX 2021 ENVIRONMENTAL, SOCIAL & GOVERNANCE REPORT CEO LETTER ESG SCORECARD PROGRESS IN 2021 We are taking the following steps toward achieving our GHG emissions reduction target: Efficiency improvements at our natural gas power generation facilities While natural gas is one of the lowest carbon emitting fossil fuel options available for power generation, we are proactively working to find efficiencies and incremental improvements that further reduce our GHG emissions intensity.
HYBRID ELECTRIC GAS TURBINE COMMISSIONED In May 2021, we commissioned Canada's first hybrid electric gas turbine at our Crossfield Energy Centre.
By combining a new battery energy storage system with our existing natural gas-fuelled turbine, the hybrid asset allows us to provide standby power (spinning reserve) without producing emissions from natural gas generation.
When a grid operator requests the standby power, the battery provides the initial supply while the turbine ramps up to meet the longer duration demand.
Since the unit went into use, it has avoided the generation of more than 31,000 tonnes carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) that would have been emitted if those power dispatches had been provided by the non-hybridized natural gas turbine.
ENMAX is leading the way in adopting and implementing this technology for the first time in Canada.
ABOUT ENMAX TURBINE UPGRADES As part of our ongoing efforts to improve operational efficiencies, we completed a turbine upgrade and maintenance event in 2021 at Shepard Energy Centre that added 11 new megawatts (MW) of generation capacity while recovering an additional 6 MW.
This further increased the efficiency at Shepard-already one of Canada's most efficient combined-cycle facilities.
A similar upgrade and maintenance event is planned for our Calgary Energy Centre in 2022.
PHYR 75-42 PWR 75-421 In 2021, our Generation Fleet Efficiency Program was recognized in Electricity Canada's (formerly known as the Canadian Electricity Association) Centre of Excellence.
WIPING RAGS SOCIAL STEAM TEMPERATURE EFFICIENCY At our Calgary Energy Centre, we completed a project to increase steam cycle temperatures.
This collaboration between a number of vendors and our multidisciplinary team optimized this operational process.
The project resulted in additional facility output and an overall efficiency improvement.
Efficiency improvements translate directly into less natural gas burn required and reduced GHG emissions.

As part of our commitment to reducing our emissions from buildings, we continue to invest in: OFFSETTING OUR BUILDING EMISSIONS ENMAX has been purchasing ECOLOGO® certified renewable energy certificates for the past 10 years to offset 100 per cent of ENMAX Place (head office) scope 2 GHG emissions.
In 2020, we set a target to offset 100 per cent of our building GHG emissions (scope 1 and scope 2) from 2021 onwards.
In alignment with our target ENMAX purchased ECOLOGO® certified renewable energy certificates and voluntary carbon offsets for our 2020 building emissions inventory to support this commitment.
Offset purchases for 2021 will be finalized in Q3 2022.
SUBSTATIONS MONITORING Sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) is a gas used as an electrical insulator in high-voltage switchgear found in substations.
Since SF6 is a powerful GHG, ENMAX Power closely monitors and reports all SF6 releases and has stringent SF6 management practices in place.
Since 79 per cent of ENMAX Power substations have SF6 gas insulated breakers, this gas is monitored by automated alarms and investigated by crews immediately.
Any gas loss is documented as part of our regular inspection and reporting process.
Additionally, we proactively replace seals to lower the probability of SF6 leaks from equipment and closely follow industry research to explore alternatives to SF6 gas.
Versant Power assets include 117 substations.
Only 35 per cent of those substations have breakers with SF6.
Versant Power maintains strict control measures to closely manage SF6 gas releases from its substations and replaces breakers when possible.
Electrifying our mobile fleet We have a mobile fleet of 348 vehicles in Alberta that are primarily used to allow our crews to inspect, maintain and repair our transmission and distribution lines, several substations and control centres.
Some of these vehicles are also used by our meter readers, community investment team members and for other corporate services.
Of this mobile fleet, approximately 39 per cent of vehicles are light duty, 39 per cent medium duty and 23 per cent heavy duty.
Last year, we announced our aspirational goal to electrify 100 per cent of our mobile fleet by 2030.
As a milestone, we set an interim target to electrify 35 per cent of our mobile fleet by 2025.
Despite some challenges related to market availability of electric vehicles (EVs) (arising from pandemic-related global supply chain and labour shortages, among other issues) and components (chip shortages), we advanced toward these targets by: MOBILE FLEET ELECTRIFICATION PLAN We developed a three-year mobile fleet electrification plan that includes our investment in both asset replacement and charging infrastructure.
The document outlines our phased approach and intended annual progress toward achieving our 2025 electrification target.
The plan will be reviewed annually and updated as technology and market conditions change.
TESTING NEW TECHNOLOGY For our medium-duty mobile fleet, we field-tested an Electric Power Takeoff (e-PTO).
An e-PTO combines a battery pack, electric motor and hydraulic pump that can raise and lower the boom on a work truck without using diesel.
Using e-PTOs would reduce mobile fleet emissions (as well as noise on the job site) since they run on battery power rather than idling the truck's diesel engine.

Absolute GHG emissions are directly correlated with the degree of utilization of our assets and our natural gas facilities have very high utilization rates.
Notes: In 2020, we changed the method of consolidation of our GHG emissions.
Before this, we reported 100 per cent of the GHG emissions from the facilities we operated, regardless of financial ownership (operational control approach under the GHG Protocol).
We have now switched to the equity approach to better reflect financial risks and rewards.
Our target baseline (2015) and all data in this chart has been restated using the equity approach.
Our GHG emissions are composed predominantly of CO2.
While we include SF6 in our GHG emissions, it represents less than one per cent of our scope 1 emissions.
Emissions from our substations include all SF6 releases but only a portion of electricity and natural gas combustion, since not all substations are directly metered.
This data excludes Versant Power.
The primary source of Versant Power's GHG emissions is gas and diesel combustion from its mobile fleet.
The company's mobile fleet includes 140 smaller-class vehicles and approximately 120 medium- and heavy-duty vehicles.
18 ENMAX 2021 ENVIRONMENTAL, SOCIAL & GOVERNANCE REPORT CEO LETTER ESG SCORECARD ABOUT ENMAX ENVIRONMENT SOCIAL GOVERNANCE TCFD APPENDICES SPOTLIGHT Medium-duty pilot advances mobile fleet electrification Recognized as an important part of global decarbonization, vehicle electrification is rapidly gaining momentum as electric vehicle (EV) technology continues to advance and build future market demand.
At ENMAX, we are working towards the full electrification of our mobile fleet by 2030.
Adopting EVs into our mobile fleet not only reduces GHG emissions-it also demonstrates the viability of EVs in industrial applications and Calgary's weather conditions and allows us to better understand the impact of transportation electrification on our electricity system.
A key way we are progressing toward our target is by advancing our medium-duty mobile fleet electrification pilot.
Initiated in 2019 with funding from Emissions Reductions Alberta, the demonstration project-the first of its kind in Canada-is testing two medium-duty (under 10,000 pounds) fully-electric work trucks within our mobile fleet.
The project could see mobile fleet fuel consumption reduced by an estimated 4,300 litres of diesel per vehicle annually.
Pilot moves to phase two In the initial phase of the pilot, the truck chassis and body were built and delivered in spring 2022.
In early fall 2021, we also installed and put into service two charging stations at our South Service Centre to help us track the performance and usage of the battery and charging infrastructure.
In the second phase of the pilot (now underway) the trucks were fully assembled, delivered to ENMAX, and put directly into operational duty in April 2022.
As the trucks are being used, we are analyzing their capacity and performance in various conditions.
This includes driving the vehicles in extreme temperatures to determine the effects on range, testing how long the battery lasts with tools in use, and taking trips on less than a full charge.
As the pilot progresses, we will continue to actively engage with suppliers, other utilities and vehicle manufacturers to support the development of the specialized EVs needed to meet our goals.

In our interactions with customers, we will continue to help them better understand and manage their energy usage and support renewable energy solutions that meet their needs, aspirations and expectations.
ENERGY USE We offer My Energy IQ™, a free tool that provides information and reports that enable customers to make informed decisions and better manage their energy use.
All residential and small business ENMAX Energy customers have convenient access to the My Energy IQ™ tools, reports and insights as part of their ENMAX Energy online account.
My Energy IQ™ enables customers to see how their home compares to similar homes nearby, build a customized savings plan, receive tips tailored to their home, see bill comparisons and historical use charts, learn what consumes the most energy in their home and how weather impacts consumption.
ELECTRICITY OR NATURAL GAS GREEN ADD-ON ENMAX Energy offers "green add-on" selections for customers to pay an additional variable fee (the amount is chosen by the customer).
For electricity consumption, this fee goes towards the purchase of certified Renewable Energy Certificates that support renewable energy generation, and for natural gas consumption this fee goes towards the purchase of carbon offsets.
ABOUT ENMAX LOWER CARBON EMISSIONS HEATING Versant Power encourages customers to switch from using fossil fuels for home heating to using electric heat pumps.
Since Maine's grid sources about 79 per cent of its electricity from renewable sources such as wind, solar, hydroelectric and biomass, switching to heat pumps results in lower emissions.
In our interactions with customers, we will continue to help them better understand and manage their energy usage and support renewable energy solutions that meet their needs, aspirations and expectations.
SOLAR INSTALLATIONS As renewable generation continues to expand in Alberta, solar remains the largest source of total installed micro-generation capacity [under five megawatts (MW) in size] at 112 MW as at the end of 20211 and ENMAX Energy continues to maintain our position as one of Alberta's leading micro-generation solar installers and retailers with more than 37 MW installed to date.
To continue to offer valuable and requested services for our customers, and in response to market drivers, ENMAX Energy will be relaunching our residential and small commercial solar program in 2022.
The rooftop solar program will offer competitive pricing and end-to-end customer service through ENMAX Energy.
To meet the increasing demand from our larger customers to help meet their ESG goals, we are also exploring renewable electricity sale agreements from utility-scale solar projects.
On a larger scale, customers in municipalities across Alberta have partnered with ENMAX for their solar needs, including 18 MW of installed solar at 58 locations such as Calgary's Shepard Solar Park, Bearspaw Water Treatment Plant and Southland Leisure Centre, to name just a few.
In 2021, ENMAX completed and energized the City of Leduc Protective Services' 88.8 kilowatt (KW) rooftop array and the Town of Calmar Arena's 185 kW rooftop array.
Toward the end of 2021, ENMAX initiated the Community Solar Fund, providing selected Calgary community associations with rooftop solar installations at their facilities.
There are currently 11 projects in progress (totalling approximately 950 kW), with an additional 15 community associations scheduled in 2022 and an additional expected ~2,200 kW of solar to be installed across Calgary.
INTEGRATING DISTRIBUTED GENERATION INTO THE GRID Across the state of Maine, Versant Power is currently supporting more than 200 distributed generation projects through their development stages-from application, engineering studies, design and construction to establishing detailed billing.
This involves integrating these renewable projects safely and efficiently within Maine's existing grid and is an important part of advancing ENMAX and Versant Power's shared vision of a cleaner energy future.

We are advancing technology solutions that will meet customer electricity needs today and into the future.
ABOUT ENMAX ENVIRONMENT SOCIAL 2021 HIGHLIGHTS > Invested $4.5 million in 2021 to enable a more resilient grid.
> Advanced our EV smart charging pilot to understand how Calgarians use EVs and the potential impact on our electricity system.
Leveraging data analytics We also use predictive programs and processes to strengthen the reliability of our system, including: PLANNING FOR LOAD CAPACITY To support reliable service to customers, we use load capacity planning to identify the existing constraints and upcoming demands on Calgary's electricity system (loads) and to verify that redundancies are in place.
Our interactive Load Capacity Map uses an ENMAX- developed load forecasting model to help communicate the estimated available capacity throughout our distribution system.
Using the map, customers can search for an address to quickly identify the system's available capacity.
SIMPLIFYING ACCESS TO COMPLEX DATA In 2021, ENMAX Power developed a System Load Analyzer, an automated approach to identify the customer load at risk under a single unplanned outage using software.
Similar to other distribution load flow software, all the different parts of the system (fuses, voltage step-down transformers, switches, overhead and underground conductors) are modeled as sections.
Nodes are used to connect sections together and to represent electrical information such as voltage and current.
Incorporating a programming language, Python, enabled us to connect the various data sources and display the information in Microsoft Power BI, a tool already in ENMAX's IT environment and accessible to all business units.
The resulting platform-called the Digital Twin-is now used by many groups across ENMAX Power to view data and gain insights more efficiently.
ENMAX 2021 ENVIRONMENTAL, SOCIAL & GOVERNANCE REPORT CEO LETTER ESG SCORECARD ABOUT ENMAX ENVIRONMENT SOCIAL GOVERNANCE TCFD APPENDICES SPOTLIGHT Delivering power reliably DRONES In Maine, drones are increasingly being used to provide top-down inspections of transmission lines in right of ways.
Versant Power has 1,270 miles of transmission lines, 900 of which are in a right-of-way.
The drones can provide an extremely detailed 360-degree look at the assets, identifying micro-cracks in porcelain insulators, and collecting valuable data.
H++ C VISUAL INSPECTIONS We regularly conduct ground line visual inspections to provide a bottom-up look at our assets in Alberta and Maine.
Typically, one to two inspectors complete these vehicle or foot patrol assessments from the road with binoculars and often use infrared or corona scanning to look for any signs of degradation.
These inspections also include wood pole condition assessments in which we make a small drill hole to determine pole strength and whether there is any rot.
Strong reliability is linked to building sufficient capacity across the system, but also to our ability to prevent, withstand and recover rapidly from system disruptions.
We are strengthening the reliability of our system through: TREE AND VEGETATION MANAGEMENT We use a combination of methods-depending on the voltage of the line-to provide the most effective long- term vegetation control, including manual tree control, brush mowing, tree trimming within the right-of-way and herbicide application.
The aim is to remove danger trees that can impact our wires before storms take them down.
Part of this work is to reclaim the full width of the right-of-way if it has become narrowed over time.
O 1 47 COVERED CONDUCTOR PROGRAM Each year in Maine, Versant Power analyzes line sections (one to two miles) with low reliability metrics and installs covered conductors.
If a tree falls on a bare wire, it can result in an outage.
With covered conductors, the insulation protects the wire so there is no short.
C INSPECTIONS MAINTENANCE & REPAIRS THERMAL AND ACOUSTIC As electrical connections loosen there is a resistance to current that can cause an increase in temperature.
In Maine, we use thermal imaging cameras to look for these hot spots which can cause components to fail.
We also complete acoustic assessments on our transmission lines, which 'listen' for devices that are slowly breaking down and thereby giving off radio frequency.
REPLACING AGING ASSETS Each year, certain assets undergo major maintenance or replacement as part of ENMAX Power and Versant Power's Capital Asset Replacement Program.
This program helps our assets run optimally and minimizes the occurrence of outages.
Assets are prioritized based on condition and other risks.
22 GOVERNANCE TCFD ENMAX 2021 ENVIRONMENTAL, SOCIAL & GOVERNANCE REPORT CEO LETTER Measuring our reliability ENMAX Power is committed to delivering power safely and reliably.
In Alberta, we operate under Alberta Reliability Standards-the requirements followed by the Alberta Electric System Operator and all electricity market participants in the province to maintain high reliability within the Alberta Interconnected Electric System.
We deliver reliability levels that are top quartile in Canada (see data from Electricity Canada (EC) in the sidebar).
In Maine, Versant Power has improved across all reliability metrics over the last few years (see table below).
To meet increased customer expectations for power reliability, Versant Power currently invests more than $70 million USD annually (approximately $87 million CAD) to maintain and improve its distribution system.
Managing and communicating outages ENMAX Power's Outage Management System estimates the origin of an outage in order to efficiently dispatch a service person to the location for restoration.
The system also automatically identifies and posts outage information for customers via Twitter and on an integrated website map (the Calgary Outage Portal Map), which shows unplanned outages occurring real-time and within the last 24 hours.
ESG SCORECARD ABOUT ENMAX ENVIRONMENT SOCIAL Minimizing the impact of outages Despite our best efforts, some of our customers experience power outages.
To minimize the impact on our customers, we invest in: AUTOMATED OUTAGE RESTORATION To substantially reduce the duration of outages and the number of customers affected, approximately 48 per cent of Calgary's non-downtown distribution system uses a technology called Distribution Automation.
This system has saved an estimated 30 million minutes of outage time over the past 10 years.
Distribution Automation is self-healing and uses SCADA (supervisory control and data acquisition) systems to detect a fault, automatically isolate it and rapidly restore the system.
INTELLIGENT DEVICES Similar to Distribution Automation in Alberta, Versant Power has installed 65 intelligent devices in Maine since 2019.
They require no operator, and they automatically detect a fault, isolate it, and rapidly restore the system.

PREPARING FOR ELECTRIC VEHICLE ADOPTION Electric vehicle (EV) adoption is increasing rapidly and EV charging (mostly done at home or work) will increase electricity demand for utilities like ours.
Since 2019, we have been progressing our understanding of EV charging behaviours.
Read more in the sidebar about our Charge Up pilot.
STORY CHARGE UP PILOT: SUPPORTING TRANSPORTATION ELECTRIFICATION EVs are no longer a distant conversation-the Canadian federal government has set a mandatory target for new light-duty cars and trucks to be zero- emission EVs by 2035.
Adjusting the grid to this rapid shift requires investing in innovation like Charge Up, our EV charging pilot, which is helping us understand how Calgarians use EVs and the impact on our electricity system.
Phase one of the pilot was focused on charger installations and baseline charging behaviour.
We provided customer rebates for the installation of 35 residential chargers and customers agreed to share their charging data with ENMAX for five years.
In this phase, we observed that EV charge times generally coincide with evening peak electricity demand and that short duration charging is common.
Building on these findings, we launched the second phase to understand the factors that influence charging behaviour (i.e., education and/or incentives) and to test smart charging, the concept of using an intelligent approach to decide when and where people charge their vehicles.
We developed a randomized trial to test the effectiveness of smart charging using two different incentive structures against a control group.
The trial is Alberta's first smart charging program that will reward customers for choosing to charge at times that benefit the grid.
We hope to use these findings to develop future programs that incentivize EV charging behaviour that optimizes the use of our distribution system.

24 ENMAX 2021 ENVIRONMENTAL, SOCIAL & GOVERNANCE REPORT CEO LETTER ESG SCORECARD ABOUT ENMAX ENVIRONMENT SOCIAL GOVERNANCE TCFD APPENDICES SPOTLIGHT Enabling customers to export renewable power to the grid Dedicated to meeting our customers' changing needs, ENMAX is working to solve a problem impacting electricity grids across North America-enabling customers on secondary networks to export excess electricity back to the grid.
A secondary network is a complex power grid with a web of multiple parallel sources of power to each customer.
These specialized networks are used to supply electricity to high-density communities requiring high reliability.
Within Calgary, ENMAX Power has four secondary networks (CF Chinook Centre, North Hill Centre, Westbrook Mall and the downtown core).
Customers connected to a secondary network rarely experience interruptions in power, but the existing design of these systems does not allow customers who own electricity generation to export excess power back to the grid.
Although this is done for safety and reliability reasons, it creates a technical barrier to adopting distributed generation in these areas.
ENMAX Power is the first utility in Canada to develop and demonstrate a solution to this complex technical challenge through a multi-year project funded in part by Natural Resources Canada and Alberta Innovates.
In collaboration with Cadillac Fairview (CF), the project will test the connection of a solar installation at CF Chinook Centre, the largest shopping complex in Calgary, onto ENMAX Power's specialized secondary network to enable two-way power flow of renewable forms of energy.
In April 2021, the project took an important step forward when we began construction of the 800 kW DC onsite solar installation on the CF Chinook Centre rooftop.
Construction of the systems that allow for electricity export was completed in the first quarter of 2022, after which we began the final phase of testing and monitoring of the two-way power flow.
The technology, if proven successful, will help remove technical and financial barriers to distributed generation, giving residential and commercial customers in urban settings more choice in how they generate and use electricity, while building the resiliency of the grid.

The last two years have intensified our resolve to enhance our resiliency and ensure business continuity and power delivery through a variety of crises.
OUR APPROACH We use the internationally recognized Incident Command System (ICS) to manage our emergency response.
ICS is a standardized command and control system used to manage emergency incidents.
We maintain a regularly reviewed Incident Management Plan, which contains all emergency response plans and protocols.
Our emergency preparedness is tailored by our power generation and transmission and distribution teams: Power generation Emergency preparedness at ENMAX Energy means ensuring our generation facility control centre, field and power plant employees are equipped to respond safely, while maintaining compliance to all legislative requirements of the Alberta Interconnected Electrical System.
Our employees receive emergency response training as part of their operational training and during regular emergency exercises.
Each year we conduct a combination of full-scale/virtual tabletop exercises, and pandemic-type exercises are now part of our scenarios.
Transmission and distribution ENMAX Power is a partner member of the Calgary Emergency Management Agency (CEMA), which plans and coordinates emergency services and resources during major emergencies and disasters in Calgary.
We participate in all their drills, exercises and preparedness planning, along with our neighbouring utilities.
This collaboration supports public and staff safety, minimizes damage to electrical infrastructure, and allows for faster recovery and return to normal operations, resulting in less disruption to our customers.
As a key CEMA member, we have seats at their Emergency Operations Centre, which opens during disasters or major emergencies and acts as The City of Calgary's coordination centre.
To test the real-time effectiveness of our response, we also complete one full-scale exercise per year with one of our closest mutual assistance partners, EPCOR.
These exercises are multi-agency, multi-jurisdictional activities involving the mobilization of emergency personnel, equipment and resources, as if a real incident had occurred.
Our aim is to complete one emergency response exercise per quarter.
We completed 25 emergency exercises in 2021 and advanced our preparedness for extreme weather events such as floods and snowstorms.
PROGRESS IN 2021 In 2021, we completed 25 emergency exercises across ENMAX.
The exercises included a combination of full-scale and/or virtual tabletop exercises at Shepard Energy Centre, Calgary Energy Centre and Cavalier Energy Centre.
At Versant Power, 12 emergency response exercises were completed in 2021.
Preparing for extreme weather events In 2021, Calgary saw both record low and record high temperatures and Western Canada experienced a wide range of extreme events including forest fires, extreme winds and severe floods.
Although our assets were not significantly impacted, we dedicated time and focus to prepare for these types of events.
During the year, ENMAX Power held three weather-related tabletop exercises, two related to flood and one simulating a large snowstorm.
Tabletop emergency exercises are sessions in which team members discuss their roles during an emergency and their responses to a particular situation, with a facilitator guiding participants through the scenario.
Our exercises involved representatives from field services, senior leadership, communications and system operations.
Some of the learnings from these exercises included improvements to our ICS organizational structure to enable more effective two-way communication and providing better support to our system operators and trouble dispatchers to assign jobs to crews for secondary outages that can occur during storms.

We carefully manage our water withdrawals and monitor our wastewater disposal.
OUR APPROACH The majority of our water use is for essential power generation processes-intake water is used for cooling purposes in cooling towers and the remainder is purified onsite to create steam in our combined- cycle power plants.
Combined-cycle facilities extract waste heat from the gas turbine exhaust and use it to create high pressure steam which produces additional electricity when allowed to depressurize.
Our water reduction initiatives have been focused on reducing facility water intensity by: Reducing potable water use We strive to minimize potable water use by using as much reclaimed water in our operations as practically possible.
Reclaimed water is wastewater that has been processed for reuse for an additional purpose before passing back into the water cycle.
By design, our largest generating facility, Shepard Energy Centre, uses 100 per cent reclaimed water from The City of Calgary's Bonnybrook Wastewater Treatment Plant for all its power generation needs.
Each year, this saves the plant from having to draw nearly six million cubic meters (m3) of freshwater from the Bow River.
We seek to optimize water use at our operated facilities in the following ways: SHEPARD ENERGY CENTRE While this facility already uses reclaimed water, we have sought to further optimize its water use.
The water used in a power plant declines in quality each time it runs through the facility, where every pass through the cooling towers increases the concentration of dissolved substances.
After three years of research, observation and innovative lab testing, we found the optimal operating efficiency of the cooling towers.
This work, which was recognized by Electricity Canada, has increased the reuse cycles from 3.5 to 5, while still maintaining all cooling water chemistry within required concentration limits.
This initiative has reduced the plant's annual wastewater volume by 24 to 28 per cent (compared to 2017 values) and reduces wastewater discharged by 450,000 m3 each year.
CALGARY ENERGY CENTRE We examined our water use at this facility and determined that the plant is already optimizing its water use to the extent possible with existing technology.
CAVALIER ENERGY CENTRE This facility is located just east of Strathmore and gets its water from an irrigation canal connected to the Bow River.
While using water from this source presents challenges due to source water quality, Cavalier uses a complex process to recycle and treat water at a very high rate of efficiency, leaving very little that cannot be recycled.

Our SOx emissions levels vary in relation to the volume of our power generation output (see data in the sidebar).
- - - 0 OUR APPROACH We diligently track and report air emissions from our power generation facilities.
We are working to reduce these emissions by incorporating emissions reduction technologies, adhering to best practices and maintaining our commitment to continuous improvement.
Nitrogen oxides We operate our facilities well below our allowable nitrogen oxide (NOx) levels, which are facility-based NOx limits granted by Alberta Environment and Parks (AEP) and provincial regulations.
To maintain these emissions levels, we utilize a combination of pre and post combustion NOx reduction technologies at our natural gas-fuelled power generation facilities.
Two of our power generation facilities use post-combustion exhaust gas treatment (ammonia injection) to reduce NOx emissions.
Crossfield Energy Centre has installed low-NOx combustors and Cavalier Energy Centre uses water injection into the turbine to control NOx.
Partnerships to protect air quality We participate as an industry member of the Clean Air Strategic Alliance (CASA) and Calgary Region Airshed Zone (CRAZ) to represent our power generation assets.
CASA is a multi-stakeholder partnership created to help manage air quality in Alberta.

Some of the ways we are working to reduce spills and improve our land stewardship practices include: ABOUT ENMAX SOCIAL STORY PROACTIVE SPILL PREVENTION AND RESPONSE We have established routine inspection programs to assess the health and condition of our generation, distribution and transmission equipment.
As part of the inspection program, the assessment of oil-filled equipment is critical as leaks can lead to equipment failure, electrical outages, and costly site clean-up and/ or remediation.
When minor leaks are identified, we increase inspection frequency to allow for ongoing monitoring and assessment of the equipment's leak severity.
In instances where a leak condition progresses or a major leak or equipment damage is identified, we schedule the repair or replacement of the equipment, including any site clean-up or remediation required.
We also have spill response and reporting procedures in place to address spills due to equipment failure, including damage and releases caused by third parties.
GOATS PROVIDE NATURAL WEED CONTROL HYDROVAC SLURRY MANAGEMENT We use hydro vacuum excavation, or hydrovac, to safely excavate around buried cables that need repairs.
Hydrovac uses high-pressure water to loosen the soil and dig a hole.
The muddy excavated material, or slurry, is then suctioned into a tank mounted on a specialized truck and taken to a designated facility.
Although a common industry practice, new regulatory guidance has highlighted additional required environmental considerations.
In 2021, ENMAX completed significant refining of our processes around pre-characterizing soils prior to hydrovac excavation.
By clearly identifying contaminants in soil, we can determine the best means of disposal or potential for reuse.
In June 2021, our Cavalier Energy Centre hosted 270 goats to graze on weeds as a means of environmentally friendly weed control.
Goats can safely eat noxious weeds and help regenerate the soil by aerating, mulching, and fertilizing.
The herd from Goats for Weeds returned to Cavalier for a second go-round later in the summer.
After repeat visits at our facility, the weed management program with the herd will shift from initial clearing to basic maintenance, saving time, money, and reducing environmental impact compared to traditional herbicide treatments.
1 A significant spill is defined as more than 500 litres, in alignment with industry standards (including Electricity Canada).
29 ENMAX 2021 ENVIRONMENTAL, SOCIAL & GOVERNANCE REPORT CEO LETTER ESG SCORECARD ENVIRONMENT SOCIAL GOVERNANCE TCFD APPENDICES Protecting biodiversity Birds often use power poles or substation equipment for perching, roosting and nesting.
Birds may also nest in areas where project or maintenance work will be carried out.
Across our operations, ENMAX works to protect birds while helping to ensure the reliability of our services by identifying high-risk areas, conducting nest sweeps prior to work, and delaying work to accommodate nesting periods.
PREVENTING DISTURBANCE TO NESTING BIRDS To avoid disturbing avian nesting and breeding habitat we regularly perform nest sweeps prior to project work.
Nest sweeps involve a search of the immediate area by trained biologists to look for breeding birds and nests.
After completing a sweep, if nesting birds are discovered, we identify locations where we can complete our work without disruption to the birds and we relocate our crews to these areas.
In 2021, we completed several sweeps as part of our work on the Calgary Ring Road project.
Many different nesting sites were identified and we were able to accommodate the nesting period without any incidents.
Across our operations, we work to protect birds while helping to ensure the reliability of our services.
ABOUT ENMAX NESTING PLATFORMS In Maine, around coastal areas, ospreys tend to build nests at the top of utility poles, which presents a danger to the birds and raises the risk of disruptions to electric service.
After a 2020 incident when an osprey built a nest on a utility pole in Lamoine, Versant Power crews wanted to prevent a future safety risk to the birds as well as the public.
As a result, Versant employees designed and built an alternate osprey nesting platform close by.
The platform was built with osprey preferences in mind and required Versant's environmental team as well as the expertise of outside environmental groups, including the Maine Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife.
Because ospreys like to be at the tallest point above the water, Versant crews replaced an existing utility pole with a taller one.
Crews installed a square platform with no coverings, as the birds prefer to look down and hunt for fish below without any obstructions overhead.
The osprey camera (powered by EarthCam) is powered entirely by solar energy and is situated on a newly built osprey platform overlooking the Mud Creek.
1 As Calgary has several fish-bearing waterbodies, osprey are common and ENMAX maintains and monitors 17 nesting platforms to provide safe places for osprey to nest.

Enhanced our safety culture through improved safety communications and stronger safety governance.
WHY IT MATTERS TO ENMAX Safety is a core value that underpins our company culture.
A solid safety record is also a key factor in attracting and retaining talent and maintaining a positive reputation.
OUR APPROACH Our robust safety policies, procedures and systems guide our work so everyone can go home safe at the end of the day.
Our Occupational Health and Safety Handbook sets out our fundamental rules, called the Rules to Live By (commonly referred to in other industries as lifesaving rules).
The rules are simple, succinct reminders of the most critical safety hazards that have caused serious injury or worker loss of life in our industry.
Focusing on high-risk activities and common injuries We have customized safety programs that target: DRIVING ENMAX mitigates driving risks through the use of: 1) Geotab devices in mobile fleet vehicles that track driver behaviour data to help reduce unsafe driving, 2) extra safety measures for our heavy mobile fleet (greater than 11,749 kilograms) such as licence class audits and specialized driver safety training courses, 3) a driving simulator that teaches about distractions and 4) supplementary training following any driving incidents.
Given Versant Power's large service territory, employees must drive long distances for work (5.8 million kilometres in 2021).
To reduce the risk of vehicle accidents, Versant Power is diligent about auditing qualifications for specific driver class licences, reinforcing driver skills in its apprenticeship program, and assisting workers with driver training.
ELECTRICAL CONTACT While only about half our employees complete work that has associated electrical hazards, it is a high-risk activity.
We follow strict lockout/tagout requirements to safely shut down, isolate or disconnect equipment to protect workers from unexpected releases of energy.
ENMAX Power's apprentice training program provides new workers with proper supervision and support and, as part of our journeyman refresher program, our Alberta powerline technicians go through annual reviews and assessments of key high-risk activities.
Versant Power has an in-house four-and- a-half-year apprenticeship program for line workers.
In 2021, seven apprentices completed the program and received their First-Class Line Worker status, and 32 are currently in various stages of progression.
In addition to apprenticeship training, in 2021, 160 field employees received additional training on topics such as testing, troubleshooting and grounding procedures for underground residential distribution systems.
SLIPS, TRIPS, AND FALLS A common cause of injuries in Alberta and Maine, slips, trips and falls are compounded by winter weather.
At our facilities, we invest in housekeeping efforts such as ploughing and salting.
We provide frequent up-front messaging prior to known hazards, such as windstorms or heavy snowfall.
We send bulletins to leaders to speak at safety meetings and provide reminders about common hazards.
ENMAX and Versant Power each have employee-based safety committees that provide opportunities to discuss these bulletins and lessons learned from past incidents.
We also encourage the use of traction aids, such as proper footwear (like ice cleats) and the use of salt de-icers to place onto snow and ice in high-traffic areas.
32 individuals are currently enrolled in our in-house four-and-a-half-year apprenticeship program for line workers in Maine.

← → 32 ENVIRONMENT SOCIAL GOVERNANCE TCFD APPENDICES ENMAX 2021 ENVIRONMENTAL, SOCIAL & GOVERNANCE REPORT CEO LETTER ESG SCORECARD PROGRESS IN 2021 To advance our vision of being a leader in proactive safety, in 2021 we increased our focus on leading indicators, strengthened our safety culture and improved our safety processes.
Moving towards a more proactive approach to safety Using leading indicators effectively requires a perspective shift-from the traditional approach of minimizing negative safety behaviours to increasing positive safety behaviours.
Key ways we are shifting our approach and metrics tracking include: INCENTING HAZARD AND NEAR MISS REPORTING Our newly developed Good Catch program incentivizes workers for noticing and reporting worksite hazards or near misses by reporting the issue in our system and to their supervisor.
The "good catches" are then shared across ENMAX via the intranet so everyone can learn from them.
LEARNING FROM NEAR MISSES We take all our near misses seriously and consider them an opportunity to learn and improve before somebody gets hurt.
In 2021, we experienced 11 near misses that were considered serious.
To address them, we performed several corrective actions focused on the root causes, including: 1) reinforcing the importance of our Employee in Charge practice which emphasizes the role of the qualified person responsible for completing a task and the safety of assigned workers (the person in charge of the worksite), 2) working to improve site communication and coordination between crews when there are multiple crews on a worksite and 3) reinforcing the importance of completing thorough field level hazard assessments.
ABOUT ENMAX CONSOLIDATING PROACTIVE METRICS INTO A SINGLE INDICATOR In 2021, we worked to develop a company-wide proactive incident rate (PAIR) calculation that combines several leading indicators (see graphic below) and measures them as a frequency rate.
In developing this metric, we collaborated and leveraged lessons learned from Versant Power, who have measured and linked their PAIR metric to performance for all team members since 2016.
Our objective for 2022 is to track this metric consistently across our organization.
PAIR: PROACTIVE INCIDENT RATE 1,319 HAZARDOUS CONDITIONS Environmental or task-related conditions identified and corrected before starting a job.
63 SAFETY JOB OBSERVATIONS Supervisors monitor job execution by employees or contractors.
2,790 NEAR MISS REPORTS At work and at home situations that could have turned into an incident.
677 SAFETY DISCUSSIONS Conversations by executive team members related to safety.
All data is as reported by our employees in 2021.

33 ENMAX 2021 ENVIRONMENTAL , SOCIAL & GOVERNANCE REPORT ENVIRONMENT GOVERNANCE TCFD APPENDICES CEO LETTER Enhancing our safety culture We encourage a proactive safety culture where every individual takes responsibility and ownership for safety, regardless of their position or work environment.
Our efforts in 2021 have been focused on building and improving our safety culture by enhancing our safety communications, broadening our safety awareness and strengthening our safety governance.
We also started collecting employee sentiment on safety which enables us to establish a baseline for comparison in future years.
In 2021, we enhanced our safety culture by: NORMALIZING HUMAN ERROR TO INCREASE VIGILANCE We use consistent messaging in our safety meetings to grow awareness that because human error is normal, we must build processes and procedures that are error tolerant and allow our workers to fail safely when incidents happen.
We distributed several company- wide safety bulletins on topics such as mental health and managing distractions.
We have also increased our communications following incidents and are sharing corrective actions across the organization.
STRENGTHENING SAFETY GOVERNANCE Across ENMAX, we have several Joint Worksite Committees (JWCs) that include a mix of leaders who meet regularly to discuss worksite safety, past incidents and lessons learned.
We increased the meeting frequency to monthly and have evolved the groups to become more cross-representative.
In 2021, we also formed a new Safety Leadership Committee that includes operational vice presidents from across the ENMAX group of companies, including Versant Power.
The committee serves as an escalation point for safety topics that cannot be resolved locally at the JWC level or for broader safety issues impacting the entire organization.
ESG SCORECARD ABOUT ENMAX SOCIAL Improving our safety processes Hazard identification and assessment is how we determine and evaluate both the existing and potential hazards in our work.
We have made improvements to several related safety processes in 2021, including: REIMAGINING HAZARD IDENTIFICATION In 2021, ENMAX Energy redeveloped and expanded its hazard identification program to cover activities across all its business units.
Now known as Assess and Share Knowledge (ASK), the program provides a formal process for workers to proactively discuss how they will perform a job, share knowledge and insights, document the conversation, and report findings to the observer and their supervisor.
UNIFYING OUR TAILBOARD PROCESS Different than hazard identification described above, which focuses on task-related hazards, workers must also complete a field-level hazard assessment to proactively identify and control hazards in their work areas and environment.
In ENMAX Power, these are called tailboards and are completed by our field teams in real-time on electronic devices.
In 2021, we integrated ENMAX Energy’s similar process called work permits into a single electronic tailboard process.
Standardizing and consolidating this process will enable improved tracking of trends in hazards and create better alignment across ENMAX.
RANKING OUR HAZARDS To better classify all identified hazards, we added hazard ranking into our system in 2021.
Hazards can now be ranked based on their probability, severity and frequency.
The rankings enable us to prioritize and maintain better quality data around the hazards observed in the field.
In addition, we can now prioritize all corrective actions and monitor them into completion.
34 Energia ENMAX 2021 ENVIRONMENTAL , SOCIAL & GOVERNANCE REPORT TCFD APPENDICES CEO LETTER ESG SCORECARD Contractor safety ABOUT ENMAX ENVIRONMENT SOCIAL GOVERNANCE 2021 HIGHLIGHTS → Added additional ESG-related questions to ISNetworld to improve our visibility into contractor safety.
→ Versant Power began its implementation of ISNetworld.
WHY IT MATTERS TO ENMAX Our contractors are a valued and essential part of our workforce.
Taking care to select contractors with best-in-class safety records and effectively managing contractor safety leads to improved engagement, alignment, stronger working relationships and improved safety for all.
OUR APPROACH We work alongside contractors who work as an extension of the ENMAX team.
In some of our business units, we also work with contracted companies, which are third parties that do work on our behalf.
Contractor safety In our ENMAX Energy-operated generation facilities, the majority of our workforce is made up of individual contractors.
The site management teams perform regular site observations and undertake the ASK process to verify that safety protocols and procedures are being followed and the work is safe.
At our Alberta corporate office locations, contractors may include, for example, security guards, cleaners or crews completing facility upgrades to ENMAX Place or our South Service Centre.
We oversee contractors working at our office locations to verify they are performing daily field-level hazard assessments and they have the proper hazard reporting protocols in place.
Working with safe companies At ENMAX Power and Versant Power, we work with contracted companies that provide construction, maintenance and other services.
We hold all contracted companies we work with to high standards of safety.
CHOOSING SAFE CONTRACTORS As part of ENMAX’s contractor selection process, each contractor across our business units must be registered with ISNetworld, an online contractor and supplier management platform used to prequalify and monitor contractors.
Each contracted company must fully demonstrate technical capabilities, adequate safety practices and have appropriate insurance in place.
We meet with selected companies to audit these items and review that they have adequate safety and environmental management systems in place.
In 2021, we incorporated additional questions regarding safety practices including their exposure hours, incidents, serious near misses and hazard reporting practices.
In some contracts we ask them to provide us with their improvement initiatives over a three-year period.
An internal dashboard allows us to monitor this data and informs decisions.
In Maine, Versant Power began implementing ISNetworld with the support of ENMAX.
CONTRACTOR MANAGEMENT To promote a consistent approach from the third parties that do work on our behalf: – Our field inspectors are onsite daily to verify that contractors use the procedures approved under the Master Service Agreement.
– We hold monthly meetings with contracted companies, including a quarterly scorecard review between the contracted company’s management and our safety team, supply chain management and management to review incidents, hazard reporting and the status of any corrective actions.
– We monitor all contracted companies to confirm that any incidents are followed up with an investigation, corrective actions and preventative measures.
While our contractor management processes are currently handled separately, at the end of 2021 we developed a plan to bring all areas of the business under one unified Contractor Management Program at ENMAX Power.
We expect to implement this program in 2022.
35 ABOUT ENMAX ENVIRONMENT GOVERNANCE TCFD APPENDICES ENMAX 2021 ENVIRONMENTAL, SOCIAL & GOVERNANCE REPORT CEO LETTER Public safety WHY IT MATTERS TO ENMAX Public safety around electricity is extremely important.
We are active in promoting the safe use of electricity in the community.
OUR APPROACH We are committed to keeping the public safe while conducting our business.
In our operations, one of the most significant risks to public safety is electrical contact with underground or overhead distribution lines or transformers.
We strive to do our part to protect, educate and inform the public about electrical safety risks through the following: Timely communication about outages As power outages can impact public safety (for example, if traffic lights go out), we maintain the ENMAX Power Trouble Response Hotline for reporting outages and offer our Calgary Outage Portal Map to publicly communicate outage location, cause and estimated time of restoration.
Versant Power also maintains a live outage map with outage information and estimated restoration times.
ESG SCORECARD Protecting the public and our assets Many types of digging or excavations can pose hazards to the public, workers and the environment.
In Alberta, before excavating, we encourage individuals to use Alberta One-Call, a free service that notifies an ENMAX team of the activity.
Additionally, our ground disturbance guidelines document provides requirements that companies and individuals must comply with when exposing buried ENMAX cables or equipment.
In Maine, Versant Power is a member of the Dig Safe® system, a communication network similar to Alberta One-Call, that notifies Versant Power prior to any intended ground disturbance by the public.
Providing power safety education We continue to broadly share our Hazardous Electrical Awareness Tutorial (HEAT), a free safety presentation available to the public and first responders that demonstrates how to work safely near electrical infrastructure in Calgary and what to do if there is a failure in the system.
To further promote power safety awareness, ENMAX's safety team has long provided the same important messages in a 90-minute presentation to contractors and first responders such as firefighters and police officers.
In 2021, ENMAX offered this session more than 34 times (with an attendance of 544 workers).
Versant Power has a public safety team composed of volunteer employees who provide safety training for fire and police departments (including the Maine State Police Academy), Emergency Medical Technicians and other civic organizations.
SOCIAL STORY PROMOTING ELECTRICITY SAFETY Although many events were cancelled in 2021 due to the pandemic, we typically participate in several annual public events to bring awareness to electricity safety, such as the Safety Expo (an event teaching school-aged children about safety around electrical lines and equipment), Disaster Alley (a free public emergency preparedness event) and the ENMAX Rodeo and Safety Expo (an event which helps the public understand how powerline technicians work safely with powerlines and electricity).
As a member of the Calgary community, we are attuned to public safety needs.
In 2021, we produced a video to promote safety behaviours during trick-or-treating.

Launched a senior leader coaching program to support leaders during times of change.
WHY IT MATTERS TO ENMAX Fostering the potential of our people is critical to our success as an organization.
Engaged employees have fewer safety incidents, are healthier and more customer- focused, and feel valued, respected and invested in their own success.
Strong employee engagement and development improves organizational effectiveness and contributes to a more satisfied workforce, increased retention and a better bottom line for our Shareholder.
OUR APPROACH We care about how committed, invested and engaged our team members are.
We understand that learning and development are critical factors in employee engagement, and therefore target our programs to support employee growth by providing opportunities for career development.
We offer competitive wages and benefits, professional development, and human resources programs and practices such as succession planning for key positions.
At ENMAX, we complete annual employee engagement surveys and are working to ingrain employee engagement into daily practices.
In Maine, Versant Power's talent acquisition practice is to source talent from the local service territory.
The company also completes employee engagement surveys and has a tuition reimbursement policy.
PROGRESS IN 2021 Over the past year, we have continued to measure and improve our employee engagement and have worked to support the learning, development and advancement of our team members in the following ways: Measuring engagement We have conducted an annual employee engagement survey through Gallup since 2019.
After each of these surveys, all employees receive access to the survey results and are involved in action planning within their teams.
In 2021, our employee participation rate reached an all-time high of 90 per cent (up from 88 per cent the previous year) and exceeded the average participation rate of 82 per cent among utility peers according to Gallup.
In all three years distributing the survey, we chose to add several questions surrounding a "culture of inclusion" to understand how confident team members are that company practices are ethical, that their voice is heard, and that they are treated inclusively and with respect.
We were encouraged to see increases in all three dimensions of the "culture of inclusion"-related questions, which suggests that employees feel our workplace operates with respect and integrity and that ENMAX is committed to building the strengths of each employee.
Since 2019, our results have shown meaningful improvements across Gallup's core engagement questions.
In November 2021, Versant Power launched its first engagement survey through Gallup, which will help provide a consistent and common line of sight on engagement across both ENMAX and Versant Power.
To follow up on the survey results, leaders will be developing and implementing action plans in 2022.

We advanced our learning and development offerings this year through: TALENT MOBILITY We continued to mature our talent programs and develop our leadership pipeline through ongoing focus on development needs, internal mobility, project work and succession planning.
Development plans include targeted leadership development opportunities, from offering education to address specific needs, to providing opportunities for leaders to gain exposure and skill development experience.
ENMAX's succession program enhances cross-functional awareness of our talent pool, identifies development areas and mitigates the risk of unexpected leadership vacancies.
Succession plans for all director-level leaders were completed in June 2021.
INDUSTRY ACUMEN This program provides industry-related information and technical knowledge for those new to ENMAX or the electricity industry.
In 2021, over 40 employees participated in a revamped program that provided new self-paced e-learning content, offered sessions hosted by ENMAX's own senior leaders, and shared industry knowledge from Western Energy Institute speakers.
MENTORSHIP We continued our internal mentorship program, which matched 141 mentors and mentees in 2021 and established mentoring relationships over six months.
COMMUNICATION FOR LEADERS We launched two programs to provide communication tools to leaders across ENMAX.
First, more than 31 directors and vice presidents received Communication for Senior Leaders, a four-week training program with one-on-one coaching that helps senior-level leaders craft a compelling vision, clear messaging and cultivate a leadership presence through their communications.
Stemming from positive feedback about the first program, we launched Speaking as a Leader.
In 2021, 20 mid-level leaders participated in this four-week program and learned how to communicate a powerful message in a concise and clear manner.
SENIOR LEADERSHIP COACHING To help our leaders navigate times of change, we identified a group of senior leaders who were leading critical transformation within their teams.
We partnered with a Calgary-based executive coaching firm to support them for six to eight months, providing each with individualized coaching to help with their leadership and personal development needs.
COACHING 101 In 2021, ENMAX also piloted a three-hour introduction to coaching program for 49 leaders, focusing on building the fundamental coaching skills and providing a framework for effective coaching conversations.
SOCIAL STORY ENGAGING OUR EMPLOYEES IN INNOVATION In spring 2021, we hosted an Innovation Challenge across our ENMAX Power and ENMAX Corporation business areas.
The goal of the challenge was to engage employees in the generation of ideas that could advance ENMAX Power's vision of meeting the future needs of our customers and communities through advancements in technology, electrification and distributed energy resources.
Team members contributed more than 70 submissions with ideas spanning automation and digitization, through to augmented and virtual reality training and everything in between.
Four winning ideas, including one employee choice, along with seven finalists were selected by a senior leadership committee.
ENMAX Power is formalizing the process to allow team members to submit project ideas throughout the year for review.
Each project will move through a governed approval process to allow for more expedited decision making and stakeholder input towards implementation.

More than 60 per cent of our workforce is represented by union members of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW) Local 254 and the Canadian Union of Public Employees (CUPE) Local 38.
Fifty per cent of Versant Power's workforce is represented by the IBEW Local 1837.
OUR APPROACH We endeavour to be proactive in our communications and transparent as decisions are made.
We consult with union representatives in advance of any policies or business initiatives that directly impact union members.
Collective bargaining agreements for both unions have a well-defined and documented process for raising grievances.
Collective agreements In 2021, ENMAX successfully negotiated a collective agreement with CUPE, which was ratified by the majority of the membership.
In 2022, ENMAX will be engaging in negotiations with the IBEW in Alberta and Versant Power with the IBEW in Maine.
Valuing our collaborative relationships We value the positive relationships we have with our bargaining unit representatives.
Some of the most common matters we work with our unions on are compensation, job stability and outsourcing.
We strive for open two-way dialogue to enable effective issue resolution.
To promote collaborative union relationships in Alberta, some of the structures we have in place include: EMPLOYEE RELATIONS COUNCIL This council (which is a bargaining item within the IBEW) is a way to work through issues or concerns that need to be resolved outside of active bargaining.
BID COMMITTEE This committee, which includes representation from IBEW and ENMAX management, meets as required to discuss any changes to job descriptions or qualifications.
JOB EVALUATION COMMITTEE Any significant changes to job descriptions go to this committee for discussion and agreement.
The committee includes representation from CUPE and the ENMAX labour relations and total rewards teams.

Increased our funding to three of our long-standing community partners to support basic needs.
WHY IT MATTERS TO ENMAX Electricity is an essential service, and energy affordability is critical to our customers' quality of life.
We aim to help eliminate barriers for vulnerable customers that may impact or inhibit access to safe, reliable and affordable electricity.
OUR APPROACH We focus our energy affordability efforts on supporting customers at each stage of the affordability lifecycle: - Crisis management - relief to customers in energy-need crisis through agency partnerships - Prevention - programming to reduce barriers to affordable-energy access Affordability - sustainable energy solutions, tools, education and awareness We have a range of community partnerships and customer programs in place to improve access to energy: Helping customers understand and optimize energy use For customers who have chosen a competitive retail plan with ENMAX Energy, we offer My Energy IQ™, a free tool to enable customers to take greater control over how they use energy via monthly reports on their energy use, bill comparisons, energy saving tips and more.
To support changing energy needs during seasonal changes, we also publish our Winter Wise and Summer Smart energy savings tips to help customers make energy usage reductions through simple, low-cost ideas tailored to Alberta's climate.
Supporting vulnerable customers In Alberta, our local customer care team offers payment arrangements or installment plans to assist customers who may be struggling to pay their electricity and/or natural gas bill.
To further support vulnerable customers with utility needs, we have long-standing relationships with Trellis Society, Distress Centre Calgary, United Way of Calgary and Area, Bissell Centre, and United Way of Central Alberta.

In Maine, Versant Power works closely with state and county programs that qualify customers to receive assistance for heating.
When customers apply for federally-funded heating assistance, they may also qualify to receive assistance through Versant Power's Low Income Assistance Program, which provides an annual credit on electric bills for income-qualified applicants each year they apply.
Low-income residential customers who fall behind on electricity bills may also be eligible for the company's Arrearage Management Program, which applies a forgiveness credit to overdue balances for on-time payments of current bills.
OUR PERFORMANCE COMMUNITY INVESTMENT SPENDING per cent 30% Of our community investment budget supported energy affordability efforts in 2021 STORY MAKING RENEWABLE POWER MORE AFFORDABLE FOR NEW HOMEOWNERS We have partnered with Attainable Homes Calgary to install solar panels (a total of 440 kW DC) on affordable housing units as part of their new REACH at Martindale development.
Attainable Homes Calgary is a non-profit organization, created and owned by The City of Calgary, which helps moderate-income Calgarians achieve quality home ownership.
REACH at Martindale is a 12-building multi-family development with an arrangement of regular and stacked townhomes and includes 116 residential homes.
To lower the cost of power for the new homeowners, each unit is designed to be highly energy efficient and will include standard solar panels.

The team is tasked with developing and implementing a strategy to promote continued attention and action on energy affordability-related efforts.
Our focus in 2022 will be on progressing our pilot projects and providing customers with access to better information on how they use and can optimize their energy.
Targeted community investment In 2020, we set a target to spend at least 30 per cent of our community investment budget each year on activities and organizations that support customers at the various stages of the energy affordability lifecycle.
In 2021, 30 per cent of our investment was directed towards this area, meeting our target.
(Read about some of our funding allocations on page 46.)
Energy saving kits pilot We are making progress towards our target to deliver 1,000 energy saving kits to Albertans by the end of 2022.
The energy saving kits are designed to support customers experiencing difficulty paying their bill and who may have higher than average energy use.
The kits include clear information on how to save energy and products that create energy savings like LED light bulbs and insulating weatherstripping.
In 2021, we trained our Customer Care team to identify customers who could most benefit from the kits.
We chose a vendor to supply the kits, worked with them to select appropriate items for the kit and developed the kit's education pieces.
Energy efficiency workshops Recognizing that education is a key part of energy affordability, we have partnered with Green Calgary in a pilot project to deliver tailored energy efficiency workshops to at least 500 people during 2022.
The workshops will provide energy efficiency strategies, tips on understanding your bill and other energy-saving content customized to the unique interests of each group (e.g., newcomers to Calgary or those who live in apartments).
Demand-side management ENMAX submitted an application to the Alberta Utilities Commission (AUC) to advocate for the development and launch of a demand-side management (DSM) program.
DSM programs encourage customers to reduce their electricity use by shifting their usage to avoid periods of high demand on the distribution system and/or through investment in energy efficiency measures.
DSM programs are common across many North American jurisdictions.
Customers enjoy many benefits of utility-led DSM programs such as reduced electricity costs and reduced environmental impacts.
ENMAX requires approval from the AUC in order to proceed with any DSM program.

In 2021, we increased our funding to three of our long-standing community partners, Trellis Society, Distress Centre Calgary and United Way of Calgary and Area.
These partnerships support the crisis intervention stage of the energy affordability lifecycle and allow us to direct people to organizations to get the help they need.
Increasing our support of these agencies means that more families and individuals will have access to funding for essential needs and services.
TRELLIS SOCIETY Trellis Society works with children, youth and families, offering programs to improve access to resources, developing family and community supports.
Among other services, they provide preschool and after-school educational programming to children, shelter for youth or families in need, and employment and housing support.
DISTRESS CENTRE Distress Centre Calgary helps provide 24-hour crisis support, professional counselling, youth peer support and referrals through 2-1-1, as well as runs programs at the multi-agency collaborative Safe Communities Opportunity and Resource Centre-all at no cost to those seeking assistance.
Although Distress Centre defines crisis broadly, they often support individuals or families experiencing domestic violence and other kinds of abuse, mental health crises and suicidal thoughts, and temporary financial hardship or homelessness.
They provide both counselling and housing services.
00 UNITED WAY United Way of Calgary and Area's Basic Needs Fund ensures individuals and families have access to basic necessities, allowing them to focus on building their strengths and move towards greater self-sufficiency.
"We are grateful to the ENMAX team for truly listening to the needs in the community and giving intentionally during such a challenging season.

WHY IT MATTERS TO ENMAX Our investments and employee volunteer contributions make a positive impact in the communities where we operate.
We continually strive to do our part to build stronger and more resilient communities.
OUR APPROACH We are committed to supporting our communities in Alberta and Maine through sponsorships, donations, partnerships and employee volunteerism.
Both ENMAX and Versant Power have been working to enhance our partnerships and focus our funding to directly target community needs and make an even bigger difference.
We aim to annually invest at least one per cent of our pre-tax profits in our communities and we achieved this goal in 2021.
ENMAX engages the London Benchmarking Group Canada (LBG) to review our community investment performance.
LBG's assessment includes ENMAX's cash donations, donations in kind and employee volunteer time, resulting in a more holistic view of our overall community contribution.
PROGRESS IN 2021 In 2021 we donated $3.25 million in total across Alberta and Maine.
ENMAX contributed $2.68 million in cash, in kind and through employee donations to local agencies, and Versant Power contributed $462,189 USD (approximately $570,000 CAD).
Over the past year at ENMAX we have: - Completed an audit of our community investment spending; - Provided top-up funding to address immediate needs in the community; - Allocated 30 per cent of our community investment budget on activities and organizations that support customers at the various stages of the energy affordability lifecycle (read more on page 44); and - Laid out a strategy for future community investment spending to increase the proportion of basic needs funding to 40 per cent by 2025.
In Maine, Versant Power: - Spoke with the 10 major partners that it had worked with across its service territory, interviewing them specifically about what their greatest needs were; - Synthesized the data, breaking it down into three phases: 1) Spring: mental health, 2) Fall: housing security and 3) Winter: energy affordability, and tailored its charitable giving budget to target those areas; and - Increased its campaign to the United Way in support of serving basic needs.
STORY SPONSORSHIP AND COMMUNITY INVESTMENT IN INDIGENOUS COMMUNITIES We look to support the economic and social development of Indigenous communities.
As one of our areas of focus, we support education programs that assist Indigenous Peoples in advancing their knowledge and skills, and support the celebration of Indigenous culture.
In 2021, we began a partnership with the Aboriginal Friendship Centre of Calgary, which brings Indigenous-based cultural programs and supports the essential needs of the urban Indigenous community in Calgary.
Our increased focus on basic needs funding across Alberta also includes an Indigenous focus.
Funding was directed to the Tsuut'ina Food Bank, the United Way of Central Alberta's Lights On Fund (which benefits the Red Deer Native Friendship Society), and to Edmonton's Bissell Centre Community Bridge Program (which supports Bent Arrow working with the Indigenous community).

Reliable energy access is correlated to improved economic trade and growth, increased safety, comfort and security, better employment opportunities, and is critical to supporting overall quality of life.
In addition to our mission of providing safe, reliable, affordable energy, our strategy includes returning a stable and growing dividend to The City of Calgary.
The dividend we pay to The City helps fund public transit, water supply and treatment services, and parks and recreation amenities.
As part of our business, we develop infrastructure projects that create enduring improvements for the province of Alberta and future generations.
We also generate value through the jobs we create, the materials we purchase and our community investments.
We are transparent about our financial position and results, and share our annual and quarterly financial reports on our website.
Our employees found creative ways to volunteer and participated in a variety of virtual, skills-based volunteering opportunities throughout 2021.
ESG SCORECARD ABOUT ENMAX Finding creative ways to give back Due to the ongoing restrictions on in-person gatherings, our employees continued to participate in a variety of virtual, skills-based volunteering opportunities throughout 2021.
Our employees found creative ways to volunteer that included being mentors with Big Brothers Big Sisters, joining seniors in virtual trivia sessions with Silvera for Seniors, donating blood through Canadian Blood Services, being pen pals for isolated students and setting up holiday lights at Alberta Children’s Hospital, Stollery Children’s Hospital and 11 Silvera for Seniors facilities.
Our Fall Give campaign is our annual employee giving program that provides our employees the chance to give back and engage with their community in ways that matter to them.
ENMAX supports this giving by matching employee donations.
In 2021, to further support energy affordability, if employees chose to donate to organizations that help enable affordable access to energy, ENMAX doubled our match of each employee donation.
More than 110 organizations received support, with five organizations receiving the double match.
Through its Good Neighbor Employee Volunteer Program and United Way campaign, Versant Power matches employee giving in Maine.
While the pandemic impacted the company’s ability to volunteer and use its Good Neighbor funds for programming important to employees, they honored employees’ wishes to provide gifts to children for the holidays and to spread holiday cheer by donating the funds to seven organizations.

ABOUT ENMAX ENVIRONMENT Ongoing stakeholder engagement We promote communication with our stakeholders in the following ways: - We offer a variety of contact avenues on our contact page in the areas of residential customer care, business customer care, and power and meter services.
- Our Customer Care Centre elicits feedback from customers through our Voice of the Customer surveys, which started in September 2019.
- We also learn what our stakeholders want through monthly engagement activities with various advocacy groups (who represent, for example, developers, builders or electrical contractors).
- When we submit a proposal to the regulator to explain a rate increase, we make those submissions available to our customers and the public on our website.
- We disclose direct contact information on our website, including access to our Board of Directors.
- We provide advance notification of any planned outages, offer an outage map and heavily engage on social media to alert customers about outages.

- We are open to receiving questions and concerns and encourage stakeholders to call us or get in touch with us through our Live Chat.
SOCIAL GOVERNANCE STORY WORKING WITH INDIGENOUS COMMUNITIES Our fundamental guiding principles-communication and trust-are instrumental in developing open and honest relationships with Indigenous communities.
An example of this is our relationship with the Tsuut'ina Nation and our operation of the electrical distribution system on the east side of their reserve lands.
In 2021, we began working with Tsuut'ina Nation on an initiative to connect several new-build homes on the reserve.
Working closely with the Nation and three Nation-owned builders, we are adding new electrical infrastructure including distribution lines, poles and transformers.
In working with the Nation members, we demonstrate respect by providing a single and consistent point of contact, promptness in our responses and a commitment to regular, face-to-face meetings.

Engaging with stakeholders and communities in Maine Versant Power aims to maintain positive relationships with its stakeholders, which include property owners, municipalities, lawmakers, elected officials, regulators, advocacy groups interested in energy policy and affordability, and business and development organizations.
Nearly all of Versant Power's transmission right-of-way areas are easements (i.e., Versant Power does not own the land, but the easements provide Versant Power with access to the property).
Versant Power believes in being good stewards of the land and being respectful, open and collaborative with all landowners.
Any time field workers require special access through woodlands, temporary licenses or leases are obtained prior to any work being done.
It is the company's practice to record before and after video inventory and to complete any mitigations or inspections with the property owner.
SOCIAL STORY ORANGE SHIRT DAY On September 30, 2021, in recognition of the National Day for Truth and Reconciliation, we participated in Orange Shirt Day across ENMAX.
This is a day to recognize the history of residential schools in Canada and to honour the survivors and their communities.
ENMAX also encourages employees to complete the online Indigenous Canada course by covering the certification fee.
Indigenous Canada is a 12-lesson course from the Faculty of Native Studies at the University of Alberta that explores Indigenous histories and contemporary issues in Canada.
GROWING OUR INDIGENOUS AWARENESS We also observed National Indigenous History Month in June and National Indigenous Peoples Day on June 21, 2021.

< > 57 CEO LETTER ENVIRONMENT APPENDICES ENMAX 2021 ENVIRONMENTAL , SOCIAL & GOVERNANCE REPORT ESG SCORECARD ABOUT ENMAX SOCIAL GOVERNANCE TCFD SPOTLIGHT The next step in modernizing the grid ENMAX Power is running a pilot project to test Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) in a few Calgary communities to improve metering capability and provide customers with actionable insights on their energy consumption.
AMI is an integrated system made up of advanced electricity meters, a wireless communications network, and the data management systems necessary to enable remote two-way communication between utilities and meters.
The ENMAX Power pilot is currently testing AMI technology on a small scale as we believe this is the next step in servicing a modernized grid.
The area included in the pilot was chosen for its good mix of residential, small, medium and large commercial customers, its sites with distributed energy resources, and its already high saturation of existing AMI-capable meters.
ADVANCED METERING + COMMUNICATION NETWORK + DATA MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS two-way communication between meters and utilities O O 1 O PILOT: HOME ENERGY MONITORS AMI-CAPABLE METERS GATEKEEPERS PROGRESS 11 10,300 AMI-capable meters installed by our meter technicians in this pilot area in 2021 5 5,531 meters successfully sent data to test in our billing system through the gatekeepers home energy monitors tested in 2021 gatekeepers installed in 2021 Home energy monitors are in-home devices that provide customers with better information on their electricity use.
Using load disaggregation technology, the devices split a customer’s load profile information into possible consumption categories (e.g., lighting, heating, appliances, etc.).
Breaking the consumption number into something more tangible provides customers with useful and actionable insights on their areas of highest energy use so they can make changes accordingly.
An AMI-capable meter offers two-way communication between users and the utility.
It is ENMAX Power's practice to install AMI-capable meters on new homes built after 2018 or sites that require meter replacements, but we have not yet harnessed their advanced metering capabilities.
Through this pilot we are testing two-way communication in select neighbourhoods.
Out of 530,000 meters in our service area, there are 190,000 homes and businesses that have AMI-capable meters already installed for future opportunities.
Gatekeepers are the centre point that collects the data from AMI-capable meters and sends it to the ENMAX Power system through a secure wireless connection—very similar to how a mobile device reports to a cell tower.
Testing on the functionality of the infrastructure began in 2021—including getting reads, testing alarms, testing remote functions and overall two-way communication capabilities, etc.
While testing on AMI technology is occurring behind the scenes, customers will not see any change to their service or bills.

Board oversight At ENMAX, the Board of Directors has the highest level of oversight for climate-related risks and opportunities.
The Board’s role is to oversee ENMAX’s strategy and the development of its ESG targets, ensure alignment between ESG efforts and business strategy, and hold responsibility for the organization’s risk profile.
In 2021, the Board approved the involvement of the Governance Committee in ESG-related matters as an enhancement to our ESG framework.
The Governance Committee supports the Board in fulfilling its role by: – Reviewing quarterly reports on ENMAX’s risk, risk rating and risk tolerance.
Our risks include environmental and social risks, climate-related risks and opportunities such as extreme weather events, carbon regulations and transition-related electricity demand changes.
– Discussing and reviewing ESG and climate-related matters at Board meetings; – Approving the publication of our annual ESG report; – Making recommendations regarding the development and ongoing refinement of our ESG targets; – Reviewing our progress and performance against our ESG targets; and – Reviewing periodic reports related to developments, trends, best practices, risks and issues related to our ESG targets and reporting.
ESG SCORECARD ABOUT ENMAX Management’s role To better understand and manage the full spectrum of climate-related risks and opportunities, we have three teams that support our Executive Team.
Two teams are focused on risk management and the other on finding opportunities.
The Risk Management Committee (RMC) is an executive-level committee whose role is to oversee our Enterprise Risk Management program.
The committee supports business units in identifying and assessing risks, and then consolidates information to be presented to the Governance Committee of the Board.
Once risks have been identified, each area of the business where the risks reside is responsible for implementing risk management plans.
The Commodity Risk Management Committee (CRMC) is similar to the RMC but focuses exclusively on identifying and managing our exposure to natural gas and electricity market risks.
This committee oversees our commodity hedging program and manages risks for our offset and Renewable Energy Certificate commercial activities.
The Renewables Business Development Group is evaluating opportunities for commercial and utility- scale renewable energy generation options backed with long-term contracts to help our customers meet their ESG goals.
STORY TCFD RECOMMENDATIONS The Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) provides recommendations for effective climate-related disclosures that can promote more informed investment, credit and insurance underwriting decisions.
The following pages outline our responses to these recommendations.
We recognize that climate change is an important and complex issue that impacts businesses and communities.
ENMAX is committed to playing an active role in the energy transition and in addressing climate change.
三 63 ENMAX 2021 ENVIRONMENTAL, SOCIAL & GOVERNANCE REPORT ABOUT ENMAX ENVIRONMENT SOCIAL GOVERNANCE TCFD APPENDICES CEO LETTER Risk management Effective risk management empowers us to actively identify, assess and manage risks to our business.
We work to develop, monitor and progress our risk management strategies to ensure they are both representative of key impact areas of our business and address changing environmental and social matters.
ENMAX uses an established Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) program to identify, analyze, evaluate, treat and communicate our risk exposures in a manner consistent with our business objectives and risk tolerance.
Our ERM program helps us monitor and evaluate financial, reputational, regulatory, environmental and social risks.
Risk identification As part of our ERM program, we identify and group risks into 10 categories that include operational, financial, regulatory, customer- and cybersecurity- related risks.
Although the categories remain relatively unchanged, the specific risks within each category are reviewed quarterly.
To support a broad understanding of risk across the company, we also identify and evaluate emerging risks, which include ESG- and transition- related risks, as well as technology disrupters and innovators.
Even if some of those risks do not meet our criteria for top risks, we discuss them with the Executive Team and the Board of Directors quarterly.
In 2019, we incorporated climate-related risks into the most impacted risk categories within our existing ERM program.
The most relevant physical and transition- related risks are summarized on page 65.
ESG SCORECARD Risk assessment For each of our identified risks categories, we evaluate the level of residual risks (after mitigation is in place).
We also use specific signposts (e.g., results of a local or federal election, publication of a regulation) to ensure consistency of risk evaluation and provide guidelines for risk assessment.
Our risk group meets quarterly and updates the Board of Directors on changes to risks assessment and/or new risks each quarter.
Risk integration We incorporate climate-related risks into different aspects of our business by: - Providing a quarterly ERM update to our Executive Team and Board of Directors with any new observations or issues related to our key risk areas and an overall assessment of our corporate-wide risk level; - Considering the impact that new investments have on our greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions profile; - Incorporating extreme weather events into emergency preparedness (read more on page 26); - Commodity risk forecasting and management; and - Severe weather planning at Versant Power to ensure resources are available for potential infrastructure impacts.
> 64 ENMAX 2021 ENVIRONMENTAL, SOCIAL & GOVERNANCE REPORT ABOUT ENMAX ENVIRONMENT SOCIAL GOVERNANCE TCFD APPENDICES CEO LETTER ESG SCORECARD Climate-related physical risks The ENMAX group of companies operates in two distinct geographical regions with different types and levels of climate-related physical risks.
While both regions are exposed to winter storms and other severe weather events, Calgary has a more targeted flood preparedness program and Maine a robust tree and vegetation management program, based on their specific regional needs.
In the next two years, we plan to develop a more robust climate mitigation plan for both areas.
Our key climate-related physical risks in Alberta include: FLOOD After the 2013 Calgary flood, we revised our internal mapping to include flood inundation zones and evacuation zones (provided annually by The City of Calgary).
Our flood maps indicate our circuitry, meters, the number of customers affected per zone and in what order.
This allows us to search and determine the equipment that would be first impacted by any overland flooding and adjust our response plans accordingly.
ENMAX continues to engage closely with Calgary Emergency Management Agency (CEMA) partners to maintain alignment and coordinate responses with these valuable partners.
We also review our flood action plan annually.
DROUGHT Since access to water is essential for several key power generation processes, prolonged drought events could impact our ability to effectively operate our facilities.
Although our areas of operation are characterized as low-to-medium baseline water stress1, our continued aim is to reduce our freshwater use and optimize water use at our operated facilities.
We minimize our freshwater use through water recycling and treatment processes and by using 100 per cent reclaimed water at our Shepard Energy Centre.
Read more on page 27.
EXTREME WEATHER EVENTS Our operations control centre proactively monitors and prepares for a variety of weather events that Environment Canada identifies as a "Watch" or "Warning" such as strong winds, heavy rain, severe hail, tornadoes and heavy snowfalls.
We categorize any event using the Incident Command System's incident level definitions (1, 2 and 3) and escalate our communications and response accordingly.
The ENMAX group of companies operates in two distinct geographical regions with different types and levels of climate-related physical risks.
STORY PREPARING FOR EXTREME WEATHER EVENTS To prepare for emergencies, we hold seven to eight emergency response exercises each year, with several focused on weather-related incidents.
We also join CEMA to participate in exercises they host.
In 2021, we held three tabletop exercises-two floods and one large snowstorm-involving representatives from field services, senior leadership, communications and system operations.
Read more on page 26.
Our key climate-related physical risks in Maine include: TREE AND VEGETATION MANAGEMENT On average at Versant Power, two out of three power outages are caused by trees.
The trees in Maine can typically grow 25 to 30 metres tall, while the average power pole reaches 10 to 14 metres, meaning trees can easily fall on powerlines.
This is why each year Versant Power covers more than 3,000 kilometres trimming trees and working with landowners to remove trees identified as threats to the reliability of the system.
To proactively address the issue, about 10 per cent of the operational budget is spent on vegetation management.
EXTREME WEATHER EVENTS With storms becoming more frequent and severe, extreme weather events pose a key physical risk to the system.
These weather events can include heavy winds, rain, ice and heavy snowfalls, and can make the risks of tree falls even greater.
Our reliability program includes replacing aging assets, covering conductors and completing a wide range of inspections to inform our maintenance plans.

65 ENMAX 2021 ENVIRONMENTAL , SOCIAL & GOVERNANCE REPORT ABOUT ENMAX ENVIRONMENT SOCIAL GOVERNANCE - TCFD APPENDICES CEO LETTER ESG SCORECARD Transition-related risks and opportunities The electricity sector, as a key player in a lower-carbon future, is experiencing rapid transformation as it responds to the opportunity of electrification, enables growth in distributed forms of renewable energy, and embraces lower carbon sources of energy as part of the energy transition.
Advancements in transportation electrification, energy storage and energy efficiency are accelerating this transition, and organizations like ENMAX have a critical role to play in supporting customers and enabling opportunity throughout this transition.
Transition-related risks and opportunities include regulatory, market and technological changes that result from the energy transition and might impact our company.
Some of these changes present both a risk and opportunity for our organization.
A component that makes ENMAX more resilient to these changes is that our power generation portfolio is composed entirely of wind power and natural gas‐ fuelled generation.
There is still uncertainty about the pace and detailed implementation of some of the regulatory and policy changes we are mentioning.
At ENMAX, we support a measured approach to the energy transition that maintains continued system reliability and takes into account affordability for customers.
We believe that federal and/or provincial funding can support environmental goals while keeping customers’ needs in mind.
TREND OR EVENT WHAT IS THE RISK?
WHAT IS THE OPPORTUNITY?
WHAT IS ENMAX DOING TO MITIGATE THE RISK?
OR TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE OPPORTUNITY?
REGULATORY Current GHG Regulation We expect GHG regulation to become more restrictive over time.
Our power generation facilities could experience higher annual operating costs due to changes in GHG pricing and regulations, such as carbon pricing, and/or other policy changes.
There is some uncertainty in Alberta after 2022, since the current regulation (TIER) is considered equivalent to the federal regulation until 2022.
The Federal Direction, outlined in a Healthy Environment and a Healthy Economy is that the Increases in carbon costs will have consumers seek options for electrification which will result in an increase in electricity demand and the need for more investment in the distribution system.
We have set a target to reach net-zero scope 1 and scope 2 emissions, with an interim target of 70% reduction by 2030 from 2015 levels.
Working towards those targets, we are currently evaluating: carbon tax will reach $170/tonne of CO₂ by 2030.
This will increase carbon compliance costs and wholesale power prices.
– Carbon Capture, Utilization, and Storage (CCUS) – Utility-scale renewables – Batteries Canada’s Commitment to Net Zero by 2050 The Canadian Net-Zero Emissions Accountability Act became law in 2021 and is supported by Canada's 2030 Emissions Reduction Plans, published in March 2022.
The main risk is a limit on production of fossil fuels.
This can have a secondary impact of reducing industrial electricity demand, which could impact ENMAX.
Any potential reduction in industrial electricity demand is likely to be offset by increases in residential electricity demand as electrification becomes a substitute for fossil fuels in different applications (e.g., passenger vehicles, residential heating).
– Hydrogen – Investing in grid resiliency Net-Zero Electricity by 2035 As part of Canada’s commitment to net-zero emissions, the Federal Government announced its intention for the electricity sector to reach that goal much earlier (by 2035).
This could have a significant impact on ENMAX generation facilities unless CCUS funding is made available that is sufficient to have CCUS installed at our natural gas power generation facilities.
This could, in turn, increase rates.
As part of this plan, Canada announced a plan to deploy $5 billion to advance clean power generation, transmission and storage across Canada.
If regulatory support is sufficient, it would support the acceleration of progress towards our target.

WHAT IS THE OPPORTUNITY?
WHAT IS ENMAX DOING TO MITIGATE THE RISK?
OR TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE OPPORTUNITY?
REGULATORY CONT'D Clean Fuel Regulation The Clean Fuel Regulation requires liquid fossil fuel primary suppliers (i.e., producers and importers) to reduce the carbon intensity of their liquid fossil fuels used in Canada from 2016 levels.
The main risk is a limit on production of fossil fuels.
This can have a secondary impact of reducing industrial electricity demand, which could impact ENMAX.
This regulation will increase the costs of gasoline and diesel to Alberta users, which may accelerate the move to electric vehicles.
This can result in an increase in electricity demand and the need for more investment in the distribution system.
ENMAX is taking steps to quantify the impacts of EV adoption on the grid (read more about our Charge Up pilot) but we believe we are well positioned to support an increase in electricity demand related to electrification of transportation.
Regulatory Support for Hydrogen In 2020, Canada published a Hydrogen Strategy to position Canada as a world-leading producer, user and exporter of clean hydrogen, and to set the country on a path to meet its climate goals.
If the support is not equally applied, the risk might be an uneven benefit to existing or new generation facilities that can be located closer to hydrogen production facilities, which may pose a disadvantage for ENMAX.
This may create financial incentives to replace natural gas with hydrogen (partially or fully) at some of our generation facilities.
Our retail natural gas business would have to adapt to the changing landscape and look for opportunities to supply hydrogen services as a substitute.
We are working with equipment manufacturers to study the feasibility of using hydrogen fuel at one of our facilities.
Read more MARKET Natural Gas Pricing Market changes will likely result in highly volatile natural gas prices.
Increases in natural gas prices result in an increase to our electricity generation costs.
This can impact our electricity and natural gas customers.
As prices are seen as more volatile, the retail contract offering can appeal to customers.
By having more electricity volumes under contract, ENMAX can more effectively manage our generation portfolio, load and GHG compliance obligations.
To reduce the risk, we have a hedging program on the power generation side that allows us to manage commodity risk exposures within levels approved by the Board and the President and CEO.
Read more about how we are helping vulnerable customers on page 44.
Increases In Renewables Coming On-Stream Renewable power generation (such as wind and solar) is increasing in the province.
An influx of renewable power generation sources coming on-stream could impact the reliability of the grid due to their intermittent nature and will require more electricity transmission infrastructure, which may add costs to customer bills.
More renewable power generation lowers the emissions intensity of the grid overall and offers ENMAX new investment opportunities in emissions-free generation.
We plan to invest $60 million with the specific goal to enable a more resilient grid by 2030 while maintaining our reliability levels.
Read more on - page 5.
More renewables may also increase the availability of offsets to be used as compliance tools in achieving our net-zero target.
Increased Demand For Electricity Beneficial electrification, defined as replacing direct fossil fuel use with electricity in a way that reduces overall emissions, is expected to be a driver for increased electricity demand.
As owners and operators of transmission and distribution assets, risks are related to the investments required to support the transmission and distribution of increased load and generation.
This presents a significant opportunity for our power generation and utility sides of the business.
ENMAX is well positioned to support an increase in electricity demand.
Electric Vehicle Adoption In 2019, sales of electric vehicles (EVs) topped 2.1 million globally, which is a 40 per cent year-on-year increase.
As owners and operators of transmission and distribution assets, risks are related to the investments required to support the transmission and distribution of increased load and generation.
The federal government has announced that more than 50 per cent of all new passenger vehicles sold in Canada will be net-zero vehicles by 2035.
The expected pace of EV adoption and the fact that charging will likely be done at home or work is expected to increase electricity demand for utilities like ours.
We are currently undertaking pilot projects, both in our own mobile fleet and for customers, to better understand the impact of this opportunity on the grid.

MARKET CONT'D Geopolitical Events Conflict between countries can impact global trade and markets and create supply chain disruptions.
Sourcing materials from countries that are impacted by geopolitical events carries the risk of longer delivery times, increased prices, and lack of availability.
Lack of availability from preferred suppliers could result in sourcing less sustainable materials and supplies.
Developing alternate supply plans which may more closely align with sustainable procurement practices.
ENMAX has engaged a third-party consultant to support the development of a Sustainable Procurement Strategy and associated actions.
This strategy will be considered when sourcing alternate supply caused by geopolitical risks.
TECHNOLOGY Advancement in Battery Technology Energy storage will play a larger role in the future as costs for battery storage technologies decline.
Energy storage technology is still in early stages of development (scale and cost challenges) and therefore does not pose a significant risk to our company.
Energy storage can create an opportunity to supplement our portfolio.
We have installed a battery storage system at Crossfield Energy Centre, which turned the facility’s existing natural gas turbine into a hybrid electric gas turbine.
Read more Advancement in Other Technologies (Hydrogen, carbon capture technology, advanced metering) Technology-related risks are related to the timing of investment.
Early investment can lead to increased cost.
Delayed investment can lead to missed opportunities.
Advancements in technology present great opportunities for us to meet our net-zero target.
We initiated a feasibility study to use hydrogen at one of our facilities.
We are also evaluating CCUS feasibility at one of our sites.
We support several technology developments, such as: – Two-way power flow – Electric mobile fleet – Advanced metering – Alberta Carbon Conversion Technology Centre Provincial and federal funding can accelerate technology advancements.
These advancements reduce technology costs over time and help to maintain energy affordability for customers.
REPUTATION Perception Around Fossil Fuel Electricity Generation Increased awareness and societal or investor activism around fossil fuels.
Customer perceptions of fossil fuels are increasing pressure on companies to reduce emissions.
ENMAX has a strong history of continual improvement in emissions reduction and will continue to seek cost- effective ways to reach environmental goals.
We have set a target to reach net-zero scope 1 and scope 2 emissions, with an interim target of 70 per cent reduction from 2015 levels.

As a first step, we looked at transition scenarios since they present the most relevant risks and opportunities to ENMAX in the short- to medium-term.
We began by developing models to assess our resiliency and test our strategy against a range of future possible climate-related policy and market conditions.
This work can inform our business planning and enable the incorporation of important climate-related risks into our decision making.
The first elements from our scenario analysis to be integrated into our business plan are carbon price, commodity price and policy application.
To inform our analysis, we leveraged the energy demand assumptions in the International Energy Agency’s (IEA) Stated Policies Scenario (STEPS) and the Net Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenario (NZE).
Carbon pricing and future electricity demand were incorporated from scenarios within Canada’s Energy Future 2021 (developed by the Canadian Energy Regulator).
We focused some of our discussions on the NZE since it is the most aggressive scenario and provides suggestions for the energy sector to achieve societal goals.
It is important to note that the NZE is a normative scenario, which means it answers the question, ‘what would need to happen so that the energy sector can achieve net-zero emissions by 2050?’ and it does not consider our starting point today.
We are encouraged by our learnings from this scenario.
ESG SCORECARD The NZE requires growth in clean energy technology including renewables, electric vehicles (EVs), battery storage, hydrogen-based fuels and energy efficiency.
As these technologies advance, development costs will decrease.
Fossil fuel use will decrease and remaining natural gas assets used for power generation will be combined with emissions reduction initiatives such as Carbon Capture, Utilization and Storage (CCUS).
Energy demand will increase with growth in electrification and population growth but will be partially offset by energy efficiency improvements.
The NZE assumes electricity generation will reach net-zero emissions globally by 2040.
Sales of new internal combustion engine passenger cars will end by 2035.
Carbon pricing or similar policy instruments will be implemented by most countries globally.
Ongoing scenario analysis will enable ENMAX to assess energy transition-related risks and ensure our business strategy evolves to mitigate these risks and take advantage of opportunities.
We plan to continue expanding and improving our scenario analysis to better inform how our Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) program addresses climate-related risks, and to support strategic action on climate change.
